For some time now I've been facing the problem of supporting my own or joint pet projects (non-commercial).
Initial problems were related to renewal of subscriptions for hosting service, they are not so difficult to solve.Some applications have used third party API services, also separate services for the database.So one day, when I updated my website with my projects, there was a difficulty to demonstrate the working versions of some of the projects that I have implemented, some of the services that have ceased to work, such as: Redis, Postgres, Heroku, Firebase. In the basic implementation, there were no problems using, but because of the excess limits there were difficulties, also the work with Heroku has become more complicated, more details

This post is more about why similar projects may not work, development of some of the applications
was to sharpen their skills or try new technologies, by the time the development was finished
the main functionality was still working, it was hard to predict in the future whether an external service would be available.
The value of actualization - I see it this way, if the project became more than just a "new technology tryout", then it makes
sense to refine or keep an eye on the project. At the moment my pet-projects carry the value of the work done and experience in the form of code. I hope for your understanding!
