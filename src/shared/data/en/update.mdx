This is the first test post about this website and its update. <br />
At the time of writing, sections with records, projects and the post page are ready.

  <b>Motivation</b>
  <br />
  The motivation was to update the visual part of the website, as well as to
  diversify the functionality of my portfolio site, which would reflect my
  technology stack and what I do.

<b>Problems</b>
<br />
Time and time again, the deadlines that I set for myself in creating this site did not justify
expectations, started writing in December 2021, made the basic functionality in which I need
there was an "about me" page instead of my old website.
<br />
The plans for the current time were to write the output of all posts, as well as a couple of articles and thoughts
about the current frontend development in particular. But now in order to fill the website with information.
<br />
<br />
<b>Backend</b><br />
Create a separate project for Nest or write in a layer from Next, chose the second, turned out to be
not the most convenient option, but for its own purposes it is still enough, but in the future
I would be thinking about switching to Nest. (since I write new pet projects on it and actively use it in the prod)
<br />
<br />
<b>SSR</b><br/>
Obviously, for ssr, the choice was on Next, but there were problems rather with libraries for processing with mdx,
the choice fell on next-mdx-remote. Not the most convenient library as it turned out. Since comparing the spelling
I found a blog under Nuxt, libraries simpler.
<br />
<br />
<b>What to write?</b><br/>
There are thoughts and ideas, but it is not clear how to design the text correctly, how it should be visually pleasing to the eye for
readings. And also thoughts on how to attract people to read?
<br/>
I was still thinking of using the portfolio site option (as a landing page), and publishing articles on habr or medium.
But I still came to the option of my own blog site.
<br />
<br />
<b>About features or what's next?</b><br/>
Add comments, post ratings, share a post, etc. <br/>
All this is available on other platforms with writing articles, but as I thought, I don't need extra functionality,
but only what is required or what I want to implement. (I would reduce it corny to laziness or to time)
<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b><br/>
Now, in general, it's hard to say whether I wanted this particular version of the site, which I wrote in the concepts or not.
<br/>
In my free time, I think to develop further and see what can be implemented, for the most part I would like to reduce
now the focus is on writing articles, possibly distributing on other services and attaching links to
the source is this site.
<br/>
Summing up, it was a trial post (thought) about what this site is and what is being done during development
here. In the footer there are links to how you can contact me if you have ideas or also thoughts)
